    /**
     * Explaination of how this works:
     *
     * The replay in the game resets whenever the session changes or when the
     * game first connects.
     *
     * We can find the `sessionChangeTime` by listening for the sessionChange
     * event and then saving the current system timestamp. Initialisation events
     * are beeing ignored.
     *
     * We can find the time when the game conntected by listening for
     * Broadcasting events. They include a timer for how long the game has
     * connected to the server. We can then calculate the `gameConnectionTime`
     * by subtracting that timer from the current system timestamtp.
     *
     * Finding the replay start timestamp is split into three cases:
     *
     * CASE 1: - The `sessionChangeTime` is known. This implies that the game
     * and this client were already connected when the session changed.
     * Theirfore the replay will start when the session changed.
     *
     * CASE 2: - The `sessionChangeTime` is not known. - The
     * `gameConnectionTime` is known. Because of the inherint delay between
     * connecting the game to the server and connecting this client to the game,
     * we cannot be sure that there was not a session change between the game
     * connection and the client connection. We can get some insite however by
     * estimating the latest possible timestamp for a session change by looking
     * at the current session time and subtracting that from the current system
     * timestamp. Because the session has been running for x amount of time, the
     * last session change cannot have happened less that x amount of time ago.
     * If the game connected less that x amount of time ago then we can use
     * `gameConnectionTime` as our replay start time. Otherwise we cannot be
     * sure and have to find the replay star time manually with CASE 3.
     *
     * CASE 3: - Replay start time cannot be determined by CASE 1 or CASE 2. or
     * - The `sessionChangeTime` is not known. - The `gameConnectionTime` is not
     * known. Start an instant replay at t ms ago for 1 second. If we get a
     * RealtimeUpdate with the replay status then t is in the replay. If we dont
     * get an Update with the replay status then t is not in the replay. Binary
     * search to find a t that is less than 5 seconds afte the replay has
     * started. Save that t as the replay start time.
